FastAPI

What is Fast API?
- [adult] FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python.
- [kid] FastAPI is a tool in Python that helps people build websites and apps that talk to each other. 

Why is this important?
- [adult]  It is based on standard Python type hints which makes it simple to use and highly readable. It is designed for speed and ease of use, with automatic validation, documentation, and support for asynchronous programming. It's designed to be fast, achieving fast performance through the use of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for data validation. 
- [kid] It helps check if things are working right and can make automatic instructions on how to use the app. It is best suited for making websites that need to do lots of things quickly. 

Why should I learn this?
- [adult] Learning FastAPI is valuable because it's one of the fastest and most efficient frameworks for building APIs. It’s in high demand in the tech industry because of its performance and ease of use. By learning it, you can quickly build modern, high-performing web applications and microservices.
- [kid] You should learn FastAPI because it can help you make websites and apps that work faster and better. It’s also fun to use and makes things easier, so you can build cool projects quickly.

When will I need this?
- [adult] You’ll need FastAPI when building APIs for web applications, mobile apps, or microservices that require high performance. It’s especially useful when handling large amounts of data, real-time updates, or situations where speed and efficiency are critical.
- [kid] You’ll need FastAPI when you want to make websites or apps that need to talk to each other really quickly. If you're building something like a game, chat app, or a website that needs to update fast, FastAPI will help you do that!

How does this work?
- [adult] FastAPI works by leveraging Python's type hints and modern web standards to automatically handle data validation, parsing, and API documentation. It uses asynchronous programming to handle multiple requests at once, making it fast and efficient. When you define endpoints in FastAPI, it automatically validates input data, provides error handling, and generates interactive documentation. It allows developers to focus more on application logic while handling the repetitive tasks efficiently in the background.
- [kid] FastAPI works by helping websites and apps talk to each other quickly. It makes sure the information you send is correct and works smoothly. When you build something with FastAPI, it helps check everything, so you don't have to worry about mistakes. It also makes everything faster by letting things happen at the same time, instead of waiting for one thing to finish before starting the next.
